Intern Assignment - Multi-Agent Game Tester POC (5 days)
Objective
Build a working POC of a multi-agent game tester for a web number/math puzzle game (target game: https://play.ezygamers.com/). The system should use LangChain for planning, generate at least 20 candidate test cases, automatically select and execute the top 10, capture artifacts, validate results using repeat and cross-agent checks, and produce a comprehensive report. The backend must be FastAPI and the frontend must provide a minimal UI to trigger planning and execution and view reports. The deliverables required for evaluation are: a GitHub repository link and a short demo video.
Note-The agent should be able to learn either using RAG technique or agentic capabilities to have correct test cases generated based on the url given or any other url.Agent should be able to open the url given and should be able to test.The test cases generated by Agent should improve with time.
You should use local model for understanding game by taking snapshot and then analyzing on how to test it 
The code should be able to play the game from opening game to executing test cases relevant to the game or the agent should be able to test ANY SIMILAR GAME URL (web-based puzzle/math games)
What to deliver (final, minimal)
●	Public GitHub link with the complete working repository.
●	Short demo video (screen capture) showing: plan generation, execution of the top 10 tests (or top 3 quick demo with mention of top 10 runs), and opening a sample report with artifacts.
Only these two items are required for submission. The code must be present and runnable in the GitHub repository or can share a web link for a running demo that we can interact with.
High-level system responsibilities
●	Generate 20+ candidate test cases using LangChain (PlannerAgent).
●	Rank candidates with a RankerAgent and select top 10.
●	Execute test cases using multiple ExecutorAgents coordinated by an OrchestratorAgent.
●	Capture step-level artifacts: screenshots, DOM snapshots, console logs, network captures.
●	Validate each test using AnalyzerAgent with repeat and cross-agent validations.
●	Produce a final report (JSON) with verdicts, evidence, reproducibility stats, and triage notes.
